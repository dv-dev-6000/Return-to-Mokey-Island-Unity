## The Game

### Overview
This project was created in Unity for a Game Customisation and Scripting module as part of the Edinburgh College Game Development HND course.
The aim was to create a 3D first person puzzle adventure game based on the popular monkey island series. 

The player is stranded on a tropical island inhabited by a magical rock hippo statue named Darnell. The player must feed darnell 8 gems in order to earn the boathouse key so they can escape. 

Gems are hidden at dig sites, the player must find the map to reveal the dig sites, and find the spade to dig up the gems. Once all 8 gems have been collected the player can trade them for the key, unlock the boathouse and escape the island.
